### Purpose / Preface
---
This repo will house examples of completed projects. They should show you what a given project might look like when fully completed. Please, when looking through these projects, don't just use them as the answers to all the students questions. In coding there are many many ways to go about completing a given task. My completed examples are what it should look like, but the way you get there can be different. Additionally I expect that you'll go through the code and try to understand it. I still think it would be a great idea to complete the project on your own, and maybe use the examples as a guide of sorts. If you don't understand it fully, that's fine! Email me! You can also email me any questions you might have as well :D I'm happy to talk about coding. 

Also you can show the examples to students, but in regards to giving them the answers themselves, please don't give it to them until project time is over. See my below question on that as well. 

And of course, students and instructional, feel free to do even more for these projects! Put your own fun spin on them! I didn't have a lot of time for these either, so definitely don't feel like your project needs to match mine exactly. 

### Some Q/A that might be useful
---
**Q: When will you be updating this repo?**
A: Things are busy, but I'll definitely have projects completed before you get to them. That being said I can't give an exact frequency of updates, so when I add a new project I'll announce it in slack.

**Q: Where's the Pokemon battle and Space invaders?**
A: Those are two large projects and I have to set aside some time to complete them. The Pokemon project is almost done, and will be here by tomorrow night latest (Wednesday 7/17/19). Space invaders will be done Thursday night at the latest. 

**Q: Can I give the link to this repo to the students?**
A: As this will have the answers to *all* projects, please do not give the link to the students until the end of the SI. What you can do is send the individual files to your students via slack. 

**Q: Where is week 1?**
A: I have all week 1 projects completed and plan to upload them soon, but that's not a priority of mine right now. If you want a project sooner please slack or email me and I'll give it to you!
